# PyBer_Analysis
analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize.

#Overview of Analysis 

For this mod I will be preforming analysis and creating a summary dataframe that will show side share data by city type (Rural, Urban, Suburban). 

Once we get this summery dataframe we will be crateing a maultible line graph that shows the total weekly fares by each city type.

the Pandas groupby() function along with the count() and sum() to get the total number of drivers, rides, and fares by city type.

Once we pulled this information and assigned it to functions we were able to calculate our average fare per ride and driver. 

Once we had all this information toghther, I formated the dataframe into a new dataframe with reformated columns. 

Now that I have a summery dataframe, I will be using the Pivot() and resample functions to create multiple line graphs that show total fares for each week by city type between the months of January april 2019. 

Results by city type.
